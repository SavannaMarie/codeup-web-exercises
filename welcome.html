    <p>Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just a little indication. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.</p>

    <p>Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. There are no limits in this world. And right there you got an almighty cloud. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. In your world you can create anything you desire.</p>

    <p>Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.</p>

    <p>This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You're meant to have fun in life. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.</p>
